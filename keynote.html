            <h2 class="center-text"><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/iamnotaceo/" target="_blank" class="link">LinkedIn Profile</a></h2>
            <p>Jeff Goldblatt is an Atlanta-based Entrepreneur with 20 years of experience in B2C Startups of many shapes and sizes (including: VC-funded, Angel-funded, and Bootstrapped… successes, failures, and that subjective gray area between… as a Founder, CoFounder, CEO, Creative Director, Consultant…) and, in recent years, as Advisor/Mentor/Coach to 100+ young founders. Originally from Massachusetts, he has an MBA from Emory University and a PhD from The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry.</p>
            <p>As creator of the original "Rejection Hotline" (a satirical fake phone number service that went super-viral, led to hundreds of other “Humor Hotlines” and evolved into a 7-figure viral content company engaging millions of fans every month), he became a nationally-recognized expert on Viral Products, Viral Content, Viral Marketing, and "VIRAL THINKING" (the title of the most popular startup workshop he has taught over the years).</p>
            <p>He feels awkward writing about himself in the 3rd Person, so he will now switch to 1st Person (and so will I)…</p>
            <p>I struggle writing bios like this because it’s easy/expected to just cherry-pick your most impressive-sounding accomplishments, awards/recognitions, maybe drop some big names and numbers… But I think that does a disservice to FUTURE Founders who rarely get full stories; so…</p>
            <p>#BeReal – Like MOST entrepreneurs, I put “CEO” on my first business card. Also like most entrepreneurs, I once believed in The Tooth Fairy. In BOTH cases, it took YEARS to realize I WAS WRONG:</p>
            <p>Despite the publicly-visible success on the product/content/fanbase side of my first business, I was severely OVERWHELMED “wearing all the hats” as an inexperienced solo founder. I had MINIMAL REVENUE and I was LOSING MONEY each month. I began struggling with my MENTAL HEALTH, experienced my first PANIC ATTACK, and considered QUITTING many times.</p>
            <p>Finally, I made a (long-overdue) decision: I FIRED MYSELF AS CEO OF MY OWN COMPANY and brought in a partner with more experience and skills complementary to mine… [Within 3 months, we raised $1 MILLION in Angel-Funding, and within 9 months, we were a PROFITABLE 7-figure company – (after YEARS of losing money on my own!) – #BestDecisionEver]</p>
            <p>My #IamNOTaCEO epiphany was undoubtedly the catalyst for my first startup success; and it began my fascination (obsession?!) with #SelfAwareness (or lack thereof!) and the MANY related problems/pitfalls that MANY young entrepreneurs are OFTEN blind to (until YEARS LATER!), often evoking the all-too-common retrospective refrain: “I Wish I Knew THEN, What I Know NOW!”</p>
            <p>Fast-Forward (more years than I care to admit) – I don’t mean to be a “Negative Nancy” or “Debbie Downer” (I prefer “Realistic Rick”), but after analyzing 500 FAILED FOUNDERS (via 500Failures.com & ReThinkingStartups.com), it is a dumbfounding reality that we see startups/founders failing today, not only at the same rates, but for many/most of the same collective reasons(!) as startups/founders 5 years ago and 10 years ago and…</p>
            <p>We  have some Innovative Improvement Initiatives and new “Startup *S.H.I.T. to Share” *[Strategies, Hypotheses, Insights, Theories] intended to address #StatusQuoBias (in Startup Communities and Early Entrepreneur Education) and to be a game-changer in PRE-startup preparation for FUTURE FOUNDERS and their journeys ahead – and I’ll be talking about it all publicly for the very first time at #HackATL 2022!</p>
